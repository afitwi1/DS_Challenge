# DS_Challenge
From the downloaded comma separated dataset, named temp_datalab_records_linkedin_company.csv, I produced some preliminary results. 
I computed the company with the highest number of followers on LinkedIn, the top 10 companies with the highest number of followers 
on LinkedIn, the industry type with the highest number of followers on LinkedIn, and the top 10 industries with the highest number 
of followers on LinkedIn based on the analyzed dataset. Corresponding barcharts (Barcharts.png) of both top ten companies  and 
industrieson LinkedIn, and trending or line graphs of the top ten companies and industry types are provided on the figure named 
TrendingGraph.png with a linear regression depiction of the top ten industries overlayed on it.

The Barcharts.png  figures show that the top ten companies have very close number of followers while there exist significant differences
among the top ten industries that increase hyperbolically (half) from the tenth to the first industry type. The banking industry
has the highest number of followers on LinkedIn social networking site.  On the TrendingGraph.png, the number of followers of the top ten 
industries show high dynamics. They increase over relatively longer period of time but they plummet to nearly nil at times. The followers
of the companies have been more or less steady over the whole period. Weis Markets is the company with the highest number of followers.
